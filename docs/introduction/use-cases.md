There are quite a few types of zombies out there. Some are common and you might come across them regardless of your environment. Others, they’re created by a unique combination of circumstances unique to your environment. Here are a few we’ve come across in our travels.

### Press F1 to continue

It rebooted. But for some reason it won’t go back to the OS till you “press F1, F2, F12 or Ctrl-Alt-Shift-Z”. Maybe the RAID battery is low. Maybe there’s some super important warning message you just have to see before booting. Or maybe it wants to eat your brains.

### Lets hangout in the BIOS

It rebooted. But then went into the BIOS. Maybe someone sent it there on purpose. Maybe it was a mistake. Or maybe it wants to eat your brains.

### No boot device found

It rebooted. But instead of PXE booting, it tried to boot from a local device and failed. Maybe someone set the wrong boot order. Maybe it’s the first time it’s booting. And maybe it just wants to eat your brains.

### Provisioning failure

It rebooted. And it even started a provisioning process, like it was supposed to. But something went wrong. Maybe it couldn’t resolve the provisioning server because of a DNS hiccup. Maybe it couldn’t pull packages because the repo is overloaded. Or maybe… brains.

### fsck it all

It rebooted. And the OS was coming up. But then it just had to run fsck on the root filesystem before bringing the network up. Maybe it hit a preset limit of mounts. Maybe it went through a cold reset mid-operation. Hmm… brains anyone?

### The BSOD

You’re running Windows. It blue screens. Brains.  
It could just as well be a Linux kernel panic. Brains #2.

### Factory pre-loaded settings

You bought new servers. You sent the settings you’d like the factory to preload well in advance. They did, but then there’s that new setting in that new firmware which disabled the network card. And now your brains hurt.

### A nice RAID UI

You wanted to set up RAID using this nice handy UI they provide after POST. But then you discover the mouse cursor has this diagonal offset… and it doesn’t click where it’s supposed to. So you find yourself using tabs to navigate. So much for your brains.
