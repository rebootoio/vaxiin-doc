You control Vaxiin via a simple command-line interface (CLI), called `vaxctl`, which uses `$HOME/.vaxctl.yaml` for [configuration](../configuration/cli). It follows a familiar paradigm you mightâ€™ve met before:

```
vaxctl [command] [TYPE] [flags]
```

Where `command`, `TYPE` and `flags` are:
- `Command`: specifies the operation that you want to perform on one or more resources, for example `create`, `get`, `edit`, `delete`.
- `TYPE`: specifies the resource types. These are case insensitive.
- `flags`: have nothing to do with countries. Some are optional, some are mandatory. You use these to select something specific to interact with, increase verbosity, etc.

You can always add the `-h` flag to get some help, for example:
```
$ vaxctl -h
