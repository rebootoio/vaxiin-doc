To install the Vaxiin framework, a minimum of 2 components are needed:
- [Vaxiin Server](server)
- [Vaxiin Handler](handler)

While the [Vaxiin agent](agent) allows for automatic discovery, zombie recognition and recovery, it is not a mandatory component.
If you choose not to install it, see [this section](../cli-reference/create#device) on how to create devices in the system.

To interact with the framework, you need to install the [Vaxiin CLI](cli).

Please see the different sections in the installation guide for details on how to install each component.
