We've created a [sandbox environment](https://github.com/rebootoio/vaxiin-sandbox) to give you quick feel for what Vaxiin can do for you.

The environment includes the vaxiin-server and some pre-loaded rules and actions for you to play around with.
You can download it [from GitHub](https://github.com/rebootoio/vaxiin-sandbox) and find instructions inside to get you going.

If you find the this resource useful and/or have ideas on how to improve it, do [let us know](https://github.com/rebootoio/vaxiin-sandbox/issues)!

If you prefer to set up the environment yourself (see the [installation instructions](../installation/server) to learn how),
we also provide a [walkthrough](walkthrough). This will guide you through using the system without assuming any pre-existing data.
Note that you'll need a test server matching one of the [supported models](../faq#what-models-do-you-support).
