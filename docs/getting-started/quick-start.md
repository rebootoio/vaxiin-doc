To get a quick feel for Vaxiin and what it can do for you, we've created a sandbox environment for you to test things out.

It includes the vaxiin-server and vaxiin-handler components, as well as some pre-loaded actions for you to play around with.
It does assume you will be providing a test server, matching one of the [supported models](../faq#what-models-do-you-support).

The environment is available [here](https://github.com/rebootoio/vaxiin-sandbox) and contains instructions to get you going.

If you find the environment useful and/or have ideas on how to improve it, do [let us know](https://github.com/rebootoio/vaxiin-sandbox/issues)!

If you prefer to set up the environment yourself based on the [installation instructions](../installation/server),
we also provide a [walkthrough](walkthrough) guiding you through using the system which  assumes no pre-existing data.
You'll still need a test server matching one of the [supported models](../faq#what-models-do-you-support).
